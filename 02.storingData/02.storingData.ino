  Learning Intention:
  The students will learn about the different data types used in the C++ language
  and how they can be converted for storage or computation
  
  Success Criteria:
    1.  I understand and can store variables in the datatypes string, interger, float, longs and boolean
    2.  I know how to access more information about the different datatypes in the documentation
    3.  I Understand how (1, HIGH and true) and (0, LOW, false) all represent the same concept and can be
        used interchangeably in an INO sketch
  
    5.  I understand the difference between an int and an unsigned int or a long or an unsigned long
    6.  I understand the difference between a global variable and a function variable
